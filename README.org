#+title: Swineherd

The [[https://www.gnu.org/software/shepherd/][GNU Shepherd]] is an elegant service manager looking after a herd of daemons.  It can be extended with the [[https://gnu.org/software/guile][Guile]] programming language.

This project aims to provide an extension to the Shepherd, retraining
it as a swineherd, a manager of crude *application containers*.  It does this by providing a Shepherd service =swineherd= that talks to the Shepherd process to create Guix System containers as Shepherd services.

Swineherd provides an optional HTTP API server to launch, manage, and
destroy containers through an HTTP client.  See the Info documentation
in the =doc/= directory for all details.
